"``tower-manage`` is a mechanism by which a Tower administrator can import"
" inventory directly into Tower, for those who cannot use Custom Inventory"
" Scripts."

"By default, inventory data already stored in Tower blends with data from "
"the external source. To use only the external data, specify "
"``--overwrite``. To specify that any existing hosts get variable data "
"exclusively from the ``--source``, specify ``--overwrite_vars``. The "
"default behavior adds any new variables from the external source, "
"overwriting keys that do not already exist, but preserves any variables "
"that were not sourced from the external data source."

"With the release of |at| 2.4.0, edits and additions to Inventory host "
"variables now persist beyond an inventory sync as long as "
"``--overwrite_vars`` is **not** set. To have inventory syncs behave as "
"they did before, it is now required that both ``--overwrite`` and "
"``--overwrite_vars`` are set."
