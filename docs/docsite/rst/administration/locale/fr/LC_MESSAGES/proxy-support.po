"Proxy servers act as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking "
"resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, "
"requesting some service or available resource from a different server, "
"and the proxy server evaluates the request as a way to simplify and "
"control its complexity."

"Using SSL offloading or using a proxy that handles SSL for Tower does not"
" work and is not supported. Tower requires the use of transparent "
"proxies. If using ELB in AWS, ensure that \"Proxy Protocol\" is not "
"enabled."

"To provide proxy server support, Tower handles proxied requests (such as "
"ELB in front of Tower, HAProxy, Squid, and tinyproxy) via the "
"``REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS`` list variable in Tower settings "
"(``/etc/tower/conf.d/remote_host_headers.py``). By default "
"``REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS`` is set to ``['REMOTE_ADDR', 'REMOTE_HOST']``."

"To enable proxy server support, setup ``REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS`` like the "
"following: ``REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS = ['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', "
"'REMOTE_ADDR', 'REMOTE_HOST']``"

"Tower determines the remote host's IP address by searching through the "
"list of headers in ``REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS`` until the FIRST IP address is "

"With the exception of ``CONTENT_LENGTH`` and ``CONTENT_TYPE``, any HTTP "
"headers in the request are converted to META keys by converting all "
"characters to uppercase, replacing any hyphens with underscores, and "
"adding an ``HTTP_`` prefix to the name. For example, a header called "
"``X-Barkley`` would be mapped to the META key ``HTTP_X_Barkley``."

"If you are behind a reverse proxy, you may want to setup a header field "
"for ``HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR``. The ``X-Forwarded-For`` (XFF) HTTP header "
"field identifies the originating IP address of a client connecting to a "
"web server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer."
