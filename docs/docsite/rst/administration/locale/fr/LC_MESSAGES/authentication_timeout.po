"Introduced in |at| 2.4 is a feature which adds an ``Auth-Token-Timeout`` "
"to every response that includes a valid user-supplied token. The value of"
" ``Auth-Token-Timeout`` is determined by the configuration (time "
"expressed in seconds) of the ``AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION``."

#: ../../source/authentication_timeout.rst:15

"The value of ``Auth-Token-Timeout`` indicates the length of time, in "

"Tower is designed to look for the ``config.js`` file first, ensuring all "
"preset configuration properties are set properly. Once loaded, Tower "
"looks for a file called ``local_settings.json`` and checks to see which, "
