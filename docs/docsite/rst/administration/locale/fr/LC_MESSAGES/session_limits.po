"Setting a session limit allows administrators to limit the number of "
"simultaneous sessions per user or per IP address."

"In |at|, a session is created for each browser that a user uses to log "
"in, which forces the user to log out any extra sessions after they exceed"
" the administrator-defined maximum."

"Session limits may be important, depending on your particular setup. For "
"example, perhaps you only want a single user on your system with a single"
" login per device (where the user could log in on his work laptop, phone,"
" or home computer). In such a case, you would want to create a session "
"limit equal to 1 (one). If the user logs in on his laptop, for example, "
"then logs in using his phone, his laptop session expires (times out) and "
"only the login on the phone persists."

"While session counts can be very limited, they can also be expanded to "
"cover as many session logins as are needed by your organization."

"When a user logs in and their login results in other users being logged "
"out, the session limit has been reached and those users who are logged "
"out are notified as to why the logout occurred."

"To make changes to your session limits, edit the ``sessions.py`` file. "
"The settings you should change are detailed below:"

msgid ""
"To make the best use of session limits, disable ``AUTH_BASIC_ENABLED`` by"
" changing the value to ``False``, as it falls outside of the scope of "
"session limit enforcement."

msgid ""
"Proactive session limits will kick the user out when the session is idle."
" It is strongly recommended that you do not set the session limit to "
"anything less than 1 minute, as doing so will break your |at| instance."
