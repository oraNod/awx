"Bason on user feedback, Ansible Tower both expands and simplifies its "
"role-based access control. No longer is job template visibility "
"configured via a combination of permissions on inventory, projects, and "
"credentials. If you want to give any user or team permissions to use a "
"job template, just assign permissions directly on the job template. "
"Similarly, credentials are now full objects in Tower’s RBAC system, and "
"can be assigned to multiple users and/or teams for use."

"A new ‘Auditor’ type has been introduced in Tower as well, who can see "
"all aspects of the systems automation, but has no permission to run or "
"change automation, for those that need a system-level auditor. (This may "
"also be useful for a service account that scrapes automation information "
"from Tower’s API.)"
