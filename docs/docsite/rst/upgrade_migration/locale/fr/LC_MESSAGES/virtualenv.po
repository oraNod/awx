"|at| 3.0 uses *virtualenv*. Virtualenv creates isolated Python "
"environments to avoid problems caused by conflicting dependencies and "
"differing versions. Virtualenv works by simply creating a folder which "
"contains all of the necessary executables and dependencies for a specific"
" version of Python. |at| creates two virtualenvs during installation--one"
" is used to run Tower, while the other is used to run Ansible. This "
"allows Tower to run in a stable environment, while allowing you to add or"
" update modules to your Ansible Python environment as necessary to run "
"your playbooks."
