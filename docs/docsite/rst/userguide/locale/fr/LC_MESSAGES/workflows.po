"Workflows allow you to configure a sequence of disparate job templates "
"that may or may not share inventory, playbooks, or permissions. However, "
"workflows have ‘admin’ and ‘execute’ permissions, similar to job "
"templates. A workflow accomplishes the task of tracking the full set of "
"jobs that were part of the release process as a single unit."

"Job templates are linked together using a graph-like structure called "
"nodes. Job template nodes are associated with job templates. A job "
"template can be a part of different workflows or used multiple times in "
"the same workflow. A copy of the graph structure is saved to a workflow "
"job when you launch the workflow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/workflows.rst:15

"As the workflow runs, jobs are spawned from the node's linked template. "
"Nodes linking to a job template which has prompt-driven fields (job_type,"
" job_tags, skip_tags, limit, and associated credential and inventory) can"
" contain those fields, and will substitute them into the job on launch. A"
" job template that is associated with each workflow node will run based "
"on the success or failure scenario as it proceeds. The successful "
"completion of a job triggers the execution of other job(s), and failure "
"of a job potentially triggers the execution of different job(s)."

"A node can have only one parent and can only have children that is linked"
" to a state of success, failure, or always. If always, then the state is "
"neither success or failure. States apply at the node level, not at the "
"workflow job template level. A workflow job will be marked as successful "
"unless it is canceled or encounters an error."

"Also similar to job templates, workflows use surveys to specify variables"
" to be used in the playbooks in the workflow, called extra_vars. Survey "
"variables are combined with extra_vars defined on the workflow job "
"template, and saved to the workflow job extra_vars. extra_vars in the "
"workflow job are combined with job template variables when spawning jobs "
"within the workflow."

"Workflows utilize the same behavior (hierarchy) of variable precedence as"
" Job Templates with the exception of three additional variables. Refer to"

"In addition to the workflow extra_vars, jobs ran as part of a workflow "

"In the workflow scheme, canceling a job cancels the branch, while "

"To edit and delete a workflow job template, you must have the admin role."
" To create a workflow job template, you must be an organization admin or "
"a system admin. However, you can run a workflow job template that "
"contains job templates you don't have permissions for. Similar to "
"projects, organization admins can create a blank workflow and then grant "
"an admin_role to a low-level user, after which they can go about "
"delegating more access and building the graph. You must have execute "
"access to a job template to add it to a workflow job template."

"Other tasks such as the ability to make a duplicate copy and re-launch a "
"workflow can also be performed, depending on what kinds of permissions "

"relaunching or making a copy."
