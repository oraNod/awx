"While Tower supports playbooks stored directly on the Tower server, best "
"practice is to store your playbooks, roles, and any associated details in"
" source control. This way you have an audit trail describing when and why"
" you changed the rules that are automating your infrastructure. Plus, it "
"allows for easy sharing of playbooks with other parts of your "
"infrastructure or team."

"Please review the Ansible best practices from the Ansible documentation "
"at http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_best_practices.html. If creating a "
"common set of roles to use across projects, these should be accessed via "
"source control submodules, or a common location such as ``/opt``. "
"Projects should not expect to import roles or content from other "
"projects."

"Playbooks should not use the ``vars_prompt`` feature, as Tower does not "
"interactively allow for ``vars_prompt`` questions. If you must use "
"``vars_prompt``, refer to and make use of the :ref:`ug_surveys` "
"functionality of Tower."

"Jobs run in Tower use the playbook directory as the current working "

#: ../../source/best_practices.rst:36
msgid ""
"If you have an external source of truth for your infrastructure, whether "
"it is a cloud provider or a local CMDB, it is best to define an inventory"
" sync process and use Tower's support for dynamic inventory (including "
"cloud inventory sources and :ref:`custom inventory scripts "
"<administration:ag_custom_inventory_script>`). This ensures your "
"inventory is always up to date."

"With the release of |at| 2.4.0, edits and additions to Inventory host "
"variables now persist beyond an inventory sync as long as "
"``--overwrite_vars`` is **not** set. To have inventory syncs behave as "
"they did before, it is now required that both ``--overwrite`` and "
"``--overwrite_vars`` are set."

msgid ""
"Keeping variable data along with the objects in Tower (see the inventory "
"editor) is encouraged, rather than using ``group_vars/`` and "
"``host_vars/``. If you use dynamic inventory sources, Tower can sync such"
" variables with the database as long as the **Overwrite Variables** "
"option is not set."

"For a Continuous Integration system, such as Jenkins, to spawn an Tower "
"job, it should make a curl request to a job template, or use the "
":ref:`Tower CLI <towerapi:api_towercli>` tool. The credentials to the job"

"Using the API to spawn jobs is covered in the :ref:`Tower API guide "
