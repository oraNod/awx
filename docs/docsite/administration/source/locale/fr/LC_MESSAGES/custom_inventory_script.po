"Tower includes built-in support for syncing dynamic inventory from cloud "
"sources such as Amazon AWS, Google Compute Engine, and Rackspace, among "

"``--overwrite_vars`` is **not** set. To have inventory syncs behave as "
"they did before, it is now required that both ``--overwrite`` and "
"``--overwrite_vars`` are set."

"You can write inventory scripts in any dynamic language that you have "
"installed on the Tower machine (such as shell or python). They must start"
" with a normal script shebang line such as ``#!/bin/bash`` or "
"``#!/usr/bin/python``. They run as the ``awx`` user. The inventory script"
" invokes with ``'--list'`` to list the inventory, which returns in a JSON"
" hash/dictionary."

"Generally, they connect to the network to retrieve the inventory from "
"other sources. When enabling multi-tenancy security (refer to "
":ref:`Security <userguide:ug_security>` for details), the inventory "
"script will not be able to access most of the Tower machine. If this "
"access to the local Tower machine is necessary, configure it in "
"``/etc/tower/settings.py``."

"For more information on dynamic inventory scripts and how to write them, "

"Inventory Sources`_ sections of the Ansible documentation, or review the "
