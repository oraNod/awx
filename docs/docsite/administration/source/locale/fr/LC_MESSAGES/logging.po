"Logging is a standalone feature introduced in |at| 3.1.0 that provides "
"the capability to send detailed logs to several kinds of 3rd party "
"external log aggregation services. Services connected to this data feed "
"serve as a useful means in gaining insight into Tower usage or technical "
"trends. The data can be used to analyze events in the infrastructure, "
"monitor for anomalies, and correlate events from one service with events "
"in another. The types of data that are most useful to Tower are job fact "
"data, job events/job runs, activity stream data, and log messages. The "
"data is sent in JSON format over a HTTP connection using minimal service-"
"specific tweaks engineered in a custom handler or via an imported "
"library."
