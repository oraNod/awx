"Beginning with version 2.2.0, |at| has moved away from using an init "
"script in favor of using an admin utility script. Previous versions of "
"|at| shipped with a standard ``ansible-tower`` init script that could be "
"used to ``start``, ``stop``, and ``query`` the full Tower infrastructure."
" It was evoked via the service command: ``/etc/init.d/ansible-tower "
"script``.  For those using a 2.2.0 or later version of |at|, the new "
"admin utility script, ``ansible-tower-service``, should be used instead."
