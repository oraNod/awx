"User authentication via Active Directory (AD), also referred to as "
"authentication through Kerberos, is supported through Ansible Tower."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To get started, first setup the Kerberos packages in the Tower system so "
"that you can successfully generate a Kerberos ticket. To install the "
"packages, use the following steps:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/kerberos_auth.rst:19
msgid ""
"Once installed, edit the ``/etc/krb.conf`` file, as follows, to provide "
"the address of the AD, the domain, etc.:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/kerberos_auth.rst:46
msgid ""
"After the configuration file has been updated, you should be able to "
"successfully authenticate and get a valid token. The following steps show"
" how to authenticate and get a token:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/kerberos_auth.rst:66
msgid ""
"Once you have a valid ticket, you can check to ensure that everything is "
"working as expected from command line. To test this, make sure that your "
"inventory looks like the following:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/kerberos_auth.rst:78
msgid ""
"You shold also: - Ensure that the hostname is the proper client hostname "
"matching the entry in AD and is not the IP address. - In the username "
"declaration, ensure that the domain name (the text after ``@``) is "
"properly entered with regard to upper- and lower-case letters, as "
"Kerberos is case sensitive. For Tower, you should also ensure that the "
"inventory looks the same."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/kerberos_auth.rst:84
msgid ""
"If you encounter a ``Server not found in Kerberos database`` error "
"message, and your inventory is configured using FQDNs (**not IP "
"addresses**), ensure that the service principal name is not missing or "
"mis-configured."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/kerberos_auth.rst:87
msgid ""
"Now, running a playbook should run as expected. You can test this by "
"running the playbook as the ``awx`` user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/kerberos_auth.rst:89
msgid ""
"Once you have verified that playbooks work properly, integration with "
"Tower is easy. Generate the Kerberos ticket as the ``awx`` user and Tower"
" should automatically pick up the generated ticket for authentication."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/kerberos_auth.rst:93
msgid ""
"The python ``kerberos`` package must be installed. Ansible is designed to"
" check if ``kerberos`` package is installed and, if so, it uses kerberos "

"If you are only planning to run playbooks against Windows machines with "
"AD usernames and passwords as machine credentials, you can use "

msgid "With Kerberos:"

"If Kerberos is installed, the password is unnecessary and the field can "
"be left blank. Instead, you must ``kinit`` a ticket at the commandline as"
" the ``awx`` user and have all the other inventory variables specified at"
" the group level."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/kerberos_auth.rst:107
msgid ""
"Kerberos needs the ticket created from ``kinit`` for authentication. Do "
"not do this as the root user. Change to the ``awx`` user before you "

"Kerberos tickets are generated every 24 hours, as the default lifetime of"
" a ticket is 24 hours. If you need to change this, edit the "
"``/etc/krb.conf`` file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/kerberos_auth.rst:116
msgid ""
"Another approach is to use ``cron`` to ``kinit`` the process every 24 "
"hours. To automate this, you must generate a keytab file which stores the"
" user password so that ``kinit`` will not prompt for the user password.  "
"Use the following steps to generate this keytab file and then get the "
"kerberos ticket:"
