"To begin, you must install Tower and you must choose a target system "
"where an initial playbook can be deployed (provided by |at|). This first "
"playbook executes simple Ansible tasks, while teaching you how to use "
"Tower, as well as ensuring its proper setup. This can be any sort of "
"system manageable by Ansible, as described at: "
"http://docs.ansible.com/intro\\_installation.html."
