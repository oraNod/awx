"You can manage playbooks and playbook directories by either placing them "
"manually under the Project Base Path on your Tower server, or by placing "
"your playbooks into a source code management (SCM) system supported by "
"Tower, including Git, Subversion, and Mercurial."

"It is recommended that, whenever possible, you use source control to "
"manage your playbooks. This type of best practice provides the ability to"
" treat your infrastructure as code and is in line with DevOps ideals. "
"While this Quick Start Guide uses lightweight examples to get you up and "
"running, we suggest using source control to manage playbook for "
"production purposes."
