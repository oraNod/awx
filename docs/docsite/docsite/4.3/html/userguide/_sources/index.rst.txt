Automation Controller User Guide |versionshortest|
====================================================


Thank you for your interest in |RHAT|. |At| helps teams manage complex multi-tier deployments by adding control, knowledge, and delegation to Ansible-powered environments.

The |atu| discusses all of the functionality available in |at| and assumes moderate familiarity with Ansible, including concepts such as **Playbooks**, **Variables**, and **Tags**. For more information on these and other Ansible concepts, please see the Ansible documentation at http://docs.ansible.com/. This document has been updated to include information for the latest release of |atversionshort|.

**We Need Feedback!**
